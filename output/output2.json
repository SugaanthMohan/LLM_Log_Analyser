    "Summary": "<i>Analyzed 65 log snippets...<i>\n\n* In this analysis, we will investigate the provided log snippets to identify and assess failure transactions, and provide the impacted customers' information.\n* We will find two separate incidents where transactions were aborted due to errors.\n* The first incident occurred at 16:10:10.385Z when the AccountProcessSystem returned an error response, causing the TellerApplication to abort the transaction and display an error message to the user.\n* The second incident happened at 16:30:05.295Z when the AccountProcessSystem encountered an invalid JSON format error, leading to the TellerApplication aborting the transaction and notifying the user of a request format error.",
    "Report": "First Incident:\n- Time: 2025-02-01T16:10:10.385Z\n- Faced By: Unknown\n- Trace Id: TRACE_876543_12398_300_1706803810\n- Application: TellerApplication\n- Component: TellerApplication\n- Customer Id: Not available\n- Customer Name: Not available\nSecond Incident:\n- Time: 2025-02-01T16:30:05.295Z\n- Faced By: Unknown\n- Trace Id: TRACE_82319_0102_200_1706807405\n- Application: TellerApplication\n- Component: TellerApplication\n- Customer Id: 12879\n- Customer Name: Gabriel",
    "Explanation": "* In the first incident, the AccountProcessSystem returned a failed response to the TellerApplication, causing the transaction to be aborted.\n* The error message displayed to the user was \"Account number not found.\n* Please check your details.\" This suggests that the AccountProcessSystem was unable to locate the account associated with the provided account number.\n* In the second incident, the AccountProcessSystem encountered an error while processing a REST request due to an invalid JSON format.\n* This led to the TellerApplication aborting the transaction and notifying the user of a request format error.",
    "ExpectedFlow": "In an ideal scenario, the following sequence of events should occur:\n1. User initiates a cash withdrawal request.\n2. TellerApplication sends a REST request to AccountProcessSystem with the account number and customer details.\n3. AccountProcessSystem processes the request and returns the customer information.\n4. TellerApplication verifies the response and completes the cash withdrawal transaction.\n5. User receives a confirmation message.",
    "Remediation": "1. For the first incident, the AccountProcessSystem should be reviewed to ensure proper handling of account number queries and prevent such errors from occurring.\n2. For the second incident, the TellerApplication should be updated to handle invalid JSON format errors more gracefully and provide users with clearer error messages.\n3. Implementing a retry mechanism for failed transactions could help improve the overall user experience and reduce the impact of errors.",
