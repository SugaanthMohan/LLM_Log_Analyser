    "Summary": "* The provided logs represent a successful withdrawal transaction sequence between the TellerApplication and AccountProcessSystem.\n* The transaction starts with the TellerApplication sending a REST request to the AccountProcessSystem to validate the account information.\n* Upon receiving the validation response, the TellerApplication proceeds with the transaction, sending another REST request to the AccountProcessSystem for debiting the account.",
    "Report": "- Time: 2025-02-01T16:10:05.226Z\n- Faced By: Unknown (logs do not provide customer details)\n- Trace Id: TRACE_987654_54321_200_1706803805\n- Application: TellerApplication\n- Component: TellerApplication\n- Additional Metadata: N/A",
    "Explanation": "* The logs show that the TellerApplication initiates the withdrawal transaction by sending a REST request to the AccountProcessSystem to validate the account information.\n* Once the account information is validated, the TellerApplication sends another REST request to the AccountProcessSystem for debiting the account.\n* The AccountProcessSystem processes both requests successfully, and the TellerApplication receives the confirmation.",
    "ExpectedFlow": "1. TellerApplication sends a REST request to AccountProcessSystem to validate account information.\n2. AccountProcessSystem validates the account information and responds with a success status.\n3. TellerApplication sends a REST request to AccountProcessSystem for debiting the account.\n4. AccountProcessSystem debits the account and responds with a success status.\n5. TellerApplication receives the confirmation and displays it to the user.",
    "Remediation": "1. Ensure proper communication between TellerApplication and AccountProcessSystem to maintain a smooth transaction flow.\n2. Implement error handling mechanisms in both applications to gracefully handle any exceptions or errors during the transaction process.\n3. Monitor the transaction flow and response times to identify any potential bottlenecks or performance issues.",
