Unable to process withdrawal due to account not found.\nThese logs indicate that there was an attempt to withdraw funds from an account that was not found in the database, resulting in a failed transaction. Subsequent attempts to withdraw from the same account may have resulted in a duplicate transaction record, causing the error.\nHere's the output in the required format:",
    "Summary": "<i>Analyzed 65 log snippets...<i>\n\n* An anomaly was observed in the logs where a withdrawal failed due to a duplicate transaction record.\n* The root cause of this issue was a failed transaction caused by an account not being found in the database, leading to subsequent attempts to withdraw from the same account and creating a duplicate transaction record.",
    "Report": "- Time: 2025-02-01T16:30:00.175Z\n- Faced By: Unknown user\n- Trace Id: TRACE_98672_0012_100_1706807400\n- Application: TellerApplication\n- Component: UI\n- Additional Metadata: None",
    "Explanation": "* The logs show that an error occurred when attempting to display an error message to the user for a withdrawal transaction.\n* The error message indicated that the withdrawal failed due to a duplicate transaction record.\n* Preceding logs reveal that the transaction was aborted due to a database constraint violation, and the account could not be found during the withdrawal process.\n* It is likely that subsequent attempts to withdraw from the same account led to the creation of a duplicate transaction record.",
    "ExpectedFlow": "1. User initiates a withdrawal request.\n2. The system checks the account balance and verifies the account exists in the database.\n3. The system processes the withdrawal request and updates the account balance accordingly.\n4. The system confirms the successful withdrawal to the user.",
    "Remediation": "1. Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent duplicate transaction records.\n2. Improve database query performance to ensure that account information is readily available during withdrawal transactions.\n3. Implement a mechanism to prevent multiple withdrawal attempts from the same account within a short time frame.",
