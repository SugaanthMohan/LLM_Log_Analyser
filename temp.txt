Understand the below log snippets and extract all the metadata for them in a dictionary format.
        Say you find timestamp, user/session Id, trace Id, log level and so on.

        {log_snippet}

        Generate a dictionary as:
        {{
            timestamp: [timestamp1, timestamp2 ... ],
            userId: [uerId1, userId2 ... ],
            sessionId: [sessionId1, sessionId2 ... ],
            traceId: [traceId1, traceId2... ]
            log level: [log level1, log level2 ... ],
            ....so on
        }}

        For you reference, here is the metadata you generated already that you can make use of to stick 
        with naming convention and syntax:
        
        {prev_metadata}
        
        If prev_metadata is empty, feel free to make use of your naming convention and syntax.
